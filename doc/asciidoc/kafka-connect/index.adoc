== Kafka Connect

Kafka Connect, an open source component of Apache Kafka, is a framework for connecting Kafka with external systems such as databases, key-value stores, search indexes, and file systems.

The Neo4j Streams project provides a Kafka Connect plugin that can be installed into the Confluent Platform enabling:

- Ingest data from Kafka topics directly into Neo4j via templated Cypher queries;
- Stream Neo4j transaction events (*coming soon*).

=== Docker compose file
