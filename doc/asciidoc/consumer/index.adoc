Is the Kafka Sink that ingest the data directly into Neo4j

=== How it works

It works in several ways:

* by providing a Cypher template
* by ingesting the events emitted from another Neo4j instance via the Change Data Capture module
* by providing a pattern extraction to a JSON or AVRO file
* by managing a CUD file format

==== Cypher Template

It works with template Cypher queries stored into properties with the following format:

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cypher.<TOPIC_NAME>=<CYPHER_QUERY>
----

Each Cypher template must refer to an *event* object that will be injected by the Sink

Following an example:

For this event

[source,javascript]
----
{
 "id": 42,
 "properties": {
   "title": "Answer to anyting",
   "description": "It depends."
 }
}
----

.neo4j.conf
[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cypher.my-topic=MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id}) \
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----

Under the hood the Sink inject the event object as a parameter in this way

[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND {events} AS event
MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id})
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----

Where `{batch}` is a json list, so continuing with the example above a possible full representation could be:

[source,cypher]
----
:params events => [{id:"alice@example.com",properties:{name:"Alice",age:32}},
    {id:"bob@example.com",properties:{name:"Bob",age:42}}]

UNWIND {events} AS event
MERGE (n:Label {id: event.id})
    ON CREATE SET n += event.properties
----

==== Change Data Capture Event

This method allows to ingest CDC events coming from another Neo4j Instance. You can use two strategies:

 * The `SourceId` strategy which merges the nodes/relationships by the CDC event `id` field (it's related to the Neo4j physical ID)
 * The `Schema` strategy which merges the nodes/relationships by the constraints (UNIQUENESS, NODE_KEY) defined in your graph model

===== The `SourceId` strategy

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cdc.sourceId=<list of topics separated by semicolon>
streams.sink.topic.cdc.sourceId.labelName=<the label attached to the node, default=SourceEvent>
streams.sink.topic.cdc.sourceId.idName=<the id name given to the CDC id field, default=sourceId>
----

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cdc.sourceId=my-topic;my-other.topic
----

Each streams event will be projected into the related graph entity, for instance the following event:

[source,json]
----
include::../producer/data/node.created.json[]
----

will be persisted as the following node:

```
Person:SourceEvent{first_name: "Anne Marie", last_name: "Kretchmar", email: "annek@noanswer.org", sourceId: "1004"}
```

as you can notice, ingested event has been projected with two peculiarities:

* the `id` field has transformed into `sourceId`;
* the node has an additional label `SourceEvent`;

these two fields will be used in order to match the node/relationship for future updates/deletes

===== The `schema` strategy

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cdc.schema=<LIST_OF_TOPICS_SEPARATE_BY_SEMICOLON>
----

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cdc.schema=my-topic;my-other.topic
----

Each streams event will be projected into the related graph entity, for instance the following event:

[source,json]
----
include::../producer/data/node.created.json[]
----

will be persisted as the following node:

```
Person{first_name: "Anne Marie", last_name: "Kretchmar", email: "annek@noanswer.org"}
```

The `Schema` strategy leverages the `schema` field in order to insert/update the nodes so no extra fields will be created.

In case of relationship

[source,json]
----
include::../producer/data/relationship.created.json[]
----

the `Schema` strategy leverages the `ids` fields in order to insert/update the relationships so no extra fields will be created.

===== The `Pattern` strategy

The `Pattern` strategy allows you to extract nodes and relationships from a json by providing a extraction pattern

Each property can be prefixed with:

* `!`: identify the id (could be more than one property), it's *mandatory*
* `-`: exclude the property from the extraction
If no prefix is specified this means that the property will be included

*Note*: you cannot mix inclusion and exclusion so if your pattern must contains all exclusion
or inclusion properties

Labels can be chained via `:`

.Tombstone Record Management
The pattern strategy come out with the support to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombstone_(data_store)[Tombstone Record],
in order to leverage it your event should contain as key the record that you want to delete and `null` for the value.

====== The `Node Pattern` configuration

You can configure the node pattern extraction in the following way:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.node.<TOPIC_NAME>=<NODE_EXTRACTION_PATTERN>
```

So for instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "name": "Andrea", "surname": "Santurbano", "address": {"city": "Venice", "cap": "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a node by providing the following configuration:


by specifying a simpler pattern:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.node.user=User{!userId}
```

or by specifying a Cypher like node pattern:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.node.user=(:User{!userId})
```

Similar to the CDC pattern you can provide:

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| User:Actor{!userId} or User:Actor{!userId,*}
| the userId will be used as ID field and all properties of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User` and `Actor`) so the persisted node will be: *(User:Actor{userId: 1, name: 'Andrea', surname: 'Santurbano', `address.city`: 'Venice', `address.cap`: 30100})*

| User{!userId, surname}
| the userId will be used as ID field and *only* the surname property of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User`) so the persisted node will be: *(User:Actor{userId: 1, surname: 'Santurbano'})*

| User{!userId, surname, address.city}
| the userId will be used as ID field and *only* the surname and the `address.city` property of the json will be attached to the node with the provided
labels (`User`) so the persisted node will be: *(User:Actor{userId: 1, surname: 'Santurbano', `address.city`: 'Venice'})*

| User{!userId,-address}
| the userId will be used as ID field and the `address` property will be excluded
so the persisted node will be: *(User:Actor{userId: 1, name: 'Andrea', surname: 'Santurbano'})*

|===

====== The `Relationship Pattern` configuration

You can configure the relationship pattern extraction in the following way:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.relationship.<TOPIC_NAME>=<RELATIONSHIP_EXTRACTION_PATTERN>
```

So for instance, given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{"userId": 1, "productId": 100, "price": 10, "currency": "€", "shippingAddress": {"city": "Venice", cap: "30100"}}
----

You can transform it into a node by providing the following configuration:

By specifying a simpler pattern:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.relationship.user=User{!userId} BOUGHT{price, currency} Product{!productId}
```

or by specifying a Cypher like node pattern:

```
streams.sink.topic.pattern.relationship.user=(:User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(:Product{!productId})
```

in this last case the we assume that `User` is the source node and `Product` the target node


Similar to the CDC pattern you can provide:

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT]->(Product{!productId}) or (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price, currency}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the other json properties on them so the persisted data will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€', `shippingAddress.city`: 'Venice', `shippingAddress.cap`: 30100}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{-shippingAddress}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties (by the exclusion) so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€'}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

| (User{!userId})-[:BOUGHT{price,currency, shippingAddress.city}]->(Product{!productId})
| this will merge fetch/create the two nodes by the provided identifier and the `BOUGHT` relationship between them. And then set all the specified json properties so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€', `shippingAddress.city`: 'Venice'}]->(Product{productId: 100})*

|===


*Attach properties to node*

By default no properties will be attached to the edge nodes but you can specify which property attach to each node. Given the following `json` published via the `user` topic:

[source,json]
----
{
    "userId": 1,
    "userName": "Andrea",
    "userSurname": "Santurbano",
    "productId": 100,
    "productName": "My Awesome Product!",
    "price": 10,
    "currency": "€"
}
----

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| pattern
| meaning

| (User{!userId, userName, userSurname})-[:BOUGHT]->(Product{!productId, productName})
| this will merge two nodes and the `BOUGHT` relationship between with all json properties them so the persisted pattern will be:
*(User{userId: 1, userName: 'Andrea', userSurname: 'Santurbano'})-[:BOUGHT{price: 10, currency: '€'}]->(Product{productId: 100, name: 'My Awesome Product!'})*

|===

====== CUD File Format

The CUD file format is JSON file that represents Graph Entities (Nodes/Relationships) and how to mange them in term
of **C**reate/**U**pdate/**D**elete operations.

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cud=<LIST_OF_TOPICS_SEPARATE_BY_SEMICOLON>
----

[source,ini]
----
streams.sink.topic.cud=my-topic;my-other.topic
----

We have one format for nodes:

[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "merge",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "ids": {"key": 1, "otherKey":  "foo"},
  "labels": ["Foo","Bar"],
  "type": "node",
  "detach": true
}
----

Lets describe the fields:

[cols="3",opts=header]
|===

| field
| mandatory
| Description

| op
| yes
| The operation type: create/merge/update/delete

*N.B.* delete messages are for **individual nodes** it’s not intended to be a generic way of doing cypher query building from JSON

| properties
| no in case the operation is `delete`, otherwise yes
| The properties attached to the node

| ids
| no in case the operation is `create`, otherwise yes
| In case the operation is merge/update/delete this field is **mandatory** and contains
the primary/unique keys of the node that will be use to do the lookup to the entity.
In case you use as key the `_id` name the cud format will refer to Neo4j's node internal for the node lookup.

*N.B.* If you'll use the `_id` reference with the op `merge` it will work as simple update, this means that if the node
with the passed internal id does not exists it will not be created.

| labels
| no
| The labels attached to the node.

*N.B.* Neo4j allows to create nodes without labels, but from a performance perspective, it's a bad idea don't provide them.

| type
| yes
| The entity type: node/relationship => node in this case

| detach
| no
| In case the operation is delete you can specify if perform a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/delete/["detach" delete] that means delete any incident relationships when you delete a node

*N.B.* if no value is provided, the default is true

|===

And one for relationships:

[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "create",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "rel-value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "rel_type": "MY_REL",
  "from": {
    "ids": {"key": 1},
    "labels": ["Foo","Bar"]
  },
  "to": {
    "ids": {"otherKey":1},
    "labels": ["FooBar"]
  },
  "type":"relationship"
}
----

Lets describe the fields:

[cols="3",opts=header]
|===
| field
| mandatory
| Description

| op
| yes
| The operation type: create/merge/update/delete

| properties
| no
| The properties attached to the relationship

| rel_type
| yes
| The relationship type

| from
| yes, if you use the `_id` field reference into `ids` you can left labels blank
| Contains the info about the source node of the relationship.
For the description of the `ids` and `labels` fields please please look at the node fields description above

| to
| yes, if you use the `_id` field reference into `ids` you can left labels blank
| Contains the info about the target node of the relationship.
For the description of the `ids` and `labels` fields please please look at the node fields description above

| type
| yes
| The entity type: node/relationship => relationship in this case

|===

=== How deal with bad data

The Neo4j Streams Plugin provides several means to handle processing errors.

It can fail fast or log errors with different detail levels.
Another way is to re-route all the data and errors that for something reason it wasn't able to ingest to a `Dead Letter Queue`.

NOTE: It behaves by default like Kafka Connect, see this https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-connect-deep-dive-error-handling-dead-letter-queues[blog post^]

* fail fast (abort) by default
* need to configure dead-letter-queue topic to enable
* need to enable logging explicitly
* headers and message logging must be enabled explicitly

Config Options

[%autowidth,cols="m,m,a",opts=header]
|===
| Name | Value | Note
| errors.tolerance | none |  fail fast (default!) abort
| errors.tolerance | all |  all == lenient, silently ignore bad messages
| errors.log.enable | false/true | log errors (default: false)
| errors.log.include.messages | false/true | log bad messages too (default: false)
| errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name | topic-name | dead letter queue topic name, if left off no DLQ, default: not set
| errors.deadletterqueue.context.header.enable | false/true | enrich messages with metadata headers like exception, timestamp, org. topic, org.part, default:false
| errors.deadletterqueue.context.header.prefix | prefix-text | common prefix for header entries, e.g. `"__streams.errors."` , default: not set
| errors.deadletterqueue.topic.replication.factor | 3/1 | replication factor, need to set to 1 for single partition, default:3
|===

In Kafka Connect you can just configure the above properties.

For the Neo4j extension you prefix them with `streams.sink.` in the Neo4j configuration.

Example settings:

.Fail Fast, Abort
[source]
----
errors.tolerance=none
----


.Don't fail on errors, Log with Messages
[source]
----
errors.tolerance=all
errors.log.enable=true
errors.log.include.messages=true
----

.Don't fail on errors, Don't log but send to DLQ with headers
[source]
----
errors.tolerance=all
errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=my-dlq-topic
errors.deadletterqueue.context.header.enable=true
----

.Same Settings for Neo4j Server Plugin
[source]
----
streams.sink.errors.tolerance=all
streams.sink.errors.deadletterqueue.topic.name=my-dlq-topic
streams.sink.errors.deadletterqueue.context.header.enable=true
----

Every published record in the `Dead Letter Queue` contains the original record `Key` and `Value` pairs and optionally the following headers:

[cols="1m,3a",opts=header]
|===
| Header key
| Description

| <prefix>topic
| The topic where the data is published

| <prefix>partition
| The topic partition where the data is published

| <prefix>soffset
| The offset of the data into the topic partition

| <prefix>class.name
| The class that generated the error

| <prefix>exception.class.name
| The exception that generated the error

| <prefix>exception.message
| The exception message

| <prefix>exception.stacktrace"
| The exception stack trace
